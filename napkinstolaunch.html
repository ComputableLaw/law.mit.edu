<p>MIT Media Lab&#39;s Dazza Greenwood (<a href="https://law.mit.edu">Law.MIT.edu</a>) and MIT Visiting Professor of Law Jonathan Askin (<a href="http://www.blipclinic.org/">BLIP Clinic</a>) are teaming up to offer an innovative project-based course at MIT this January for entreprenuers and others with new venture ideas to learn and apply integrated business/legal/technical rapid prototyping skills for quick-start development of &quot;back of the napkin&quot; ideas. &nbsp;The course is structured around sessions for project hacking and review/feedback and sessions for learning and skill-building focused on key business, legal, and technical issues, options, and opportunities for project success.</p>

<p class="rtecenter"><strong>Bitcin and Blockchain</strong></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">The course content significantly focuses on working with Bitcoin and other Blockchain related technologies as the basis for potential new venture business models, legal structures, and technical solutions. &nbsp;The course will provide opportunities for skill building and mentorship with experts from&nbsp;</span><a href="https://consensys.net/about/" style="line-height: 20.8px;">Consensus Systems</a><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;for&nbsp;</span>developer and end-user tools to <span style="line-height: 20.8px;">build decentralized applications for&nbsp;</span>blockchain ecosystems, focusing primarily on Ethereum.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">The Napkins to Launch course features a special track with an enterprising group of Sloan Fellows during IAP this January to hone and develop their new venture ideas into &quot;hackable&quot; projects for rapid prototyping. &nbsp;The resulting project descriptions, media, and related materials will be published on the 2016 Open Innovation Network gallary of small-team, quick-turnaround projects for Hackathons, MOOCs, rapid prototyping workshops, and online charrettes.&nbsp;</span></p>
